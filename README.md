# FestManagement

Addresses the problems faced by people during conduction of large scale events.

The best way to handle this would be to digitize the entire process. Every person working for the fest has a login created on the website. For example: I am an EVM and my event is to be conducted in 5 days. So I can send requests to the Design Department for a poster, to the Logistics Dept for banner printing, to QCM for write up approval. All of that can be achieved in a single click rather than communicating through a third party and not being present on the loop.
